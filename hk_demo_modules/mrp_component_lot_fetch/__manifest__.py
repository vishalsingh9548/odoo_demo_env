    'description': """
Adds an "Assign Component Lots" button on confirmed Manufacturing Orders.
For each component line whose Lot/Serial Number column is still empty, it
looks up the oldest available stock lot in the source location (FIFO by
incoming date) - the same lot that was generated when that product was
purchased and received into inventory - and fills it in.

This module is standalone and does not modify any existing module or flow.
