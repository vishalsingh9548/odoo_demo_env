    Inventory SOH (Stock on Hand) Report.

    Changes:
        - Added sku (product default_code)
        - Renamed qty_inward label to 'Purchased Qty'
        - Added variance_value = variance * cog_before_sale
        - actual_soh moved before variance in view
        - variance_value now uses the product variant's own Cost price
          instead of cog_before_sale (which also included labelling/
          packaging costs, overstating the value of a stock variance)
        - qty_on_hand/qty_inward/qty_consumption/qty_return/qty_wastage/
          ideal_soh/actual_soh/variance are shown in kg (not grams) for
