    """
    MO-wise Raw Material Consumption.

    Standalone report — does not read from, write to, or otherwise touch
    inventory.soh.report (Inventory SOH Report) or mo.cost.report
    (MO Cost Report) in any way.

    One row per (raw material, Manufacturing Order): how much of that raw
    material was consumed as a component in that specific done MO, plus
    the MO's own number and Production Date. Because the grain is one row
    per MO (not one row per product), Production Date can be grouped by
    month like any normal Odoo report — that's not possible on Inventory
    SOH Report, which is one row per product with no date anywhere on it.

    Deliberately does NOT include On Hand, Purchased, Return, Wastage,
    Ideal SOH, Actual SOH, Variance or Value. Those are lifetime totals
    for the product as a whole, not something that happened "at" a
    specific MO — there is no accurate way to show them on a per-MO row:
    repeating the same product-level number on every one of that
    product's MO rows would silently overcount if anyone summed the
    column (e.g. a product with 56 MOs would have its On Hand added up
    56 times instead of once). Leaving this report to just Qty Consumed
    — the one column that genuinely has a real, distinct value per MO —
    was a deliberate accuracy decision, not an oversight.

    Reuses the exact same "raw material consumption" definition already
    used by inventory_soh_report's own `consumption` CTE (done stock
    moves, from an internal location to a non-internal one, linked to a
    Manufacturing Order's component consumption, on a product that isn't
    a finished good) — just grouped by (product, MO) instead of summed to
    one lifetime total. Also applies the same gram→kg display conversion
    inventory_soh_report uses, for consistency between reports.
